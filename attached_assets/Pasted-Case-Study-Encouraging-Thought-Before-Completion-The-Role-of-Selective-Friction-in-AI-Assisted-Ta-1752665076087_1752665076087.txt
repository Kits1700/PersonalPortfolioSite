1. Executive Summary
In an era of rapidly integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT into professional and academic workflows, a critical challenge has emerged: user overreliance. This project investigates how strategically designed "selective friction" within AI-assisted interfaces can mitigate passive acceptance of AI outputs, thereby fostering deeper critical engagement and thoughtful human cognition. Through a mixed-methods user study utilizing a custom-built web application, this research aims to demonstrate that subtle, task-relevant interactive barriers, implemented before AI-generated content is revealed, can enhance analytical thinking, maintain user trust, and increase productive cognitive effort, ultimately leading to more informed and higher-quality human-AI collaboration.
2. The Challenge: Mitigating Overreliance on AI
The proliferation of powerful general-purpose LLMs has revolutionized how individuals approach cognitively demanding tasks such as academic writing, argument development, and information synthesis. While offering unprecedented efficiency, this convenience has inadvertently cultivated a pervasive issue: user overreliance.
Users increasingly tend to passively accept AI-generated content without sufficient critical engagement, reflection, or contextualization. This automated bias carries significant risks:
Diminished Critical Thinking: Users may cede their analytical faculties to the AI, reducing their ability to scrutinize or question information.
Reduced Contextualization: Nuanced reasoning and understanding of complex information may suffer if users do not actively connect AI outputs to broader contexts.
Uncritical Acceptance of Errors: There is an increased likelihood of uncritically integrating incorrect or suboptimal AI suggestions.
While prior research has explored "cognitive forcing functions" (CFFs) – deliberate interaction hurdles designed to promote critical thinking – these interventions have largely been confined to specialized, domain-specific contexts (e.g., medical diagnosis). A significant gap exists in understanding how these mechanisms translate to the open-ended, creative, and knowledge-work tasks now commonly assisted by general-purpose LLMs. Furthermore, a persistent design tension has been identified: generic frictions, while potentially reducing overreliance, can paradoxically erode user trust and increase cognitive load, hindering adoption.
This project addresses this critical challenge by seeking to design friction that is not merely an interruption, but a constructive and task-relevant scaffold for human cognition.
3. The Solution: Selective Friction for Enhanced Engagement
To counteract AI overreliance, our project introduces the concept of selective friction: small, purposeful interaction barriers embedded directly into the user interface before AI-generated content is displayed. Unlike generic hurdles, these frictions are meticulously designed to be task-relevant, guiding users toward active cognitive engagement rather than mere passive consumption.
A. Core Design Principles of Selective Friction:
Task-Relevant: Frictions are directly related to the cognitive task at hand, making them feel integral rather than arbitrary.
Scaffolding, Not Hindering: The barriers are intended to support and guide users' thought processes, prompting reflection and analysis.
Embedded in Workflow: Frictions are seamlessly integrated into the natural flow of the AI-assisted task, minimizing disruption.
Promotes Critical Engagement: By requiring a preparatory cognitive task, users are compelled to actively engage with the problem space before seeing AI's solution.
Mitigates Automation Bias: Encourages users to evaluate AI output with a more critical lens, reducing uncritical acceptance.
B. System Implementation & Prototype:
The core of this research is a custom-built web application designed for experimental control, which is not available in commercial LLM interfaces. This platform is being developed using Figma (for design prototyping) and Replit (for web application development), integrated with the OpenAI GPT-4 API for powerful language model capabilities.

C. Friction Intervention Examples:
The prototype will feature two distinct cognitive domains, each with specific friction interventions:
Literature Review Generation:
Friction Task: Users are required to rank abstracts or engage with source material before accessing the AI-generated literature review.
Goal: To encourage pre-computation, familiarization with content, and a more critical evaluation of AI's synthesis.
Argument Brainstorming:
Friction Task: Users must actively formulate a counterargument or consider an opposing viewpoint before the AI provides its suggested arguments.
Goal: To stimulate dialectical thinking and prevent confirmation bias from immediately accepting the AI's first suggestions.

4. Methodology: A Rigorous Mixed-Methods User Study
To rigorously test the hypotheses and explore the nuanced impact of selective friction, this project employs a robust mixed-methods user study.
A. Research Design:
Approach: Mixed-methods, combining quantitative analysis with qualitative insights.
Core Design: Counterbalanced within-subjects design. Each participant experiences both friction and no-friction conditions across different tasks, serving as their own control. This minimizes the impact of individual differences in AI literacy and attitudes.
B. Participants & Recruitment:
Target: At least 25 participants.
Criteria: Individuals with regular and demonstrable experience using LLMs for substantive knowledge work (e.g., academic research, content creation). This purposive sampling ensures participants are familiar with baseline AI interaction models.
C. Experimental Procedure:
Each participant will complete four tasks (two literature review generation, two argument brainstorming), experiencing both no-friction (control) and friction (experimental) conditions. The sequence of conditions will be fully counterbalanced to eliminate order effects.
Onboarding & Pre-Study: Informed consent and a pre-study questionnaire (including dispositional trust measures).
Task Completion: Four experimental tasks, each followed by a post-task questionnaire.
Post-Study: Final overall questionnaire and a brief, semi-structured interview.

D. Data Collection & Measures:
A multi-faceted approach will capture both behavioral and perceptual data:
Behavioral Logs: Automatically recorded interaction metrics from the platform, including time spent on friction tasks and LLM usage patterns.
Self-Report Questionnaires:
Task-Specific Trust: Using items from the Trust between People and Automation (TPA) scale.
Dispositional Trust: Measured at baseline using the General Trust Scale.
Cognitive Effort: Captured using the validated NASA Task Load Index (NASA TLX).
Critical Engagement & Overreliance: Custom items informed by automation bias and human-AI interaction literature.
Qualitative Interviews: Semi-structured interviews exploring user strategies, system understanding, and experiences with friction.
5. Results & Validation (Future Content)
Following the completion of participant recruitment and data collection, a rigorous analysis will be performed to evaluate the impact of selective friction.
A. Quantitative Analysis:
Primary Technique: Repeated measures ANOVA will be applied to analyze differences in self-report and behavioral metrics across friction and no-friction conditions.
Hypotheses to Test:
H1: Friction will reduce overreliance on AI and increase critical engagement with AI-generated outputs.
H2: Friction will maintain or enhance perceived trustworthiness and usefulness of the AI.
H3: Friction will increase productive cognitive effort.
