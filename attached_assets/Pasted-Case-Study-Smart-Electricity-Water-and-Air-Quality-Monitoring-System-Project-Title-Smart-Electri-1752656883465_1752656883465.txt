2. The Problem: Unsustainable Resource Consumption & Pollution
Rapid urbanization and industrialization have led to a critical degradation of environmental quality and unsustainable consumption of vital resources.
Declining Quality: Air and water quality are significantly deteriorating due to pollution from various sources, posing severe health risks and impacting ecosystems.
Resource Depletion: Non-renewable resources like electrical energy are consumed inefficiently, threatening long-term sustainability.
Inefficient Traditional Systems: Conventional resource monitoring relies heavily on manual readings, which are prone to errors, tedious, lack real-time feedback, and offer no predictive capabilities. This prevents users from understanding their consumption patterns or taking timely corrective actions.
Lack of Integrated Solutions: Existing smart solutions often focus on a single resource, rather than providing a holistic view of electricity, water, and air quality.
This created a pressing need for a comprehensive, real-time, and user-friendly system that empowers individuals and organizations to manage their environmental footprint more effectively.
3. The Solution: A Two-Fold Smart Monitoring System
Our proposed "Smart Electricity, Water, and Air Quality Monitoring System" addresses these challenges through a novel integration of IoT and Machine Learning, focusing on affordability and user empowerment.
A. System Architecture:
The system comprises two primary interconnected components:
IoT System:

Hardware: Utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller as the main processing unit, connected to the sensors. A NodeMCU facilitates internet connectivity.
Communication: Sensor data is transmitted via APIs to a web application and cloud platforms (Google Sheets for data storage, Adafruit Dashboard for real-time electricity monitoring).
Affordability: Designed to mimic smart meter functionality at a significantly lower cost.
Machine Learning System:
Data Processing: Real-time sensor data from Google Sheets is retrieved, cleaned (e.g., converting PPM/NTU to float/datetime, handling NaN values), and prepared for analysis using Python libraries.
Forecasting & Prediction: Machine learning algorithms are applied to the collected data to forecast future trends in air and water quality, and predict resource usage.
User Interface: A centralized web application dashboard (and mobile app concept) displays real-time sensor values, predicted forecasts, and generates alerts when consumption or quality thresholds are exceeded.

C. Machine Learning Models Evaluated:
A comparative study was conducted on three prominent machine learning models for forecasting air and water quality:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A type of recurrent neural network suitable for sequential data.
ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average): A statistical model for time series data analysis and forecasting.
Random Forest Regression: An ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees, known for its robustness and accuracy.
5. Results & Impact
The prototype demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the integrated IoT and ML system.
A. Real-time Performance:
The IoT system achieved near real-time data updates, with a delay of approximately 0.5 seconds between sensor reading and dashboard display. This low latency ensures instantaneous alerts and up-to-date monitoring.
B. Machine Learning Model Performance:
Models were trained on a dataset of around 400 entries. Evaluation metrics used were Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Comparative Analysis (MAE):

Random Forest Regression: 15.53
Conclusion: The Random Forest Regression model significantly outperformed LSTM and ARIMA, exhibiting the lowest error scores (MAE of 15.53) and providing the most accurate forecasts for air and water quality. This was attributed to its ensemble nature and robustness with limited data points.
