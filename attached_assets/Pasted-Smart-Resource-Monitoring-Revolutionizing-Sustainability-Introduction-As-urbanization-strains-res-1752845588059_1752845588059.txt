Smart Resource Monitoring: Revolutionizing Sustainability

Introduction

As urbanization strains resources and degrades air and water quality, the "Smart Electricity, Water, and Air Quality Monitoring System," presented at the 2023 IEEE 8th International Conference for Convergence in Technology, offers a transformative solution. This IoT and machine learning system uses affordable sensors (ACS712, MQ135) and a Random Forest Regressor (2.94 RMSE) to deliver real-time insights and predictive analytics via a user-friendly web and mobile dashboard, empowering sustainable resource management for households and businesses.

My Role

As lead developer and researcher, I designed the IoT architecture, integrated sensors with Arduino Uno and NodeMCU, and built the machine learning pipeline for forecasting. I conducted comparative model analysis (LSTM, ARIMA, Random Forest), developed the web application’s backend, and ensured seamless data flow. Collaborating with Dr. Anala M R under an IBM Shared University Research grant, I led the project from ideation to deployment.

The Challenge

Manual resource monitoring is costly, error-prone, and lacks predictive capabilities, leaving users unaware of overconsumption or quality issues. The goal was to create a system that:





Monitors electricity, water, and air quality affordably and accurately.



Predicts future trends for proactive management.



Provides intuitive, real-time insights via mobile and web interfaces.



Overcomes the high costs of traditional smart meters.

The Design Process

Research & Insights

We analyzed Automated Meter Reading (AMR) and IoT-based systems, identifying gaps in multi-resource monitoring and user accessibility. Affordable sensors and cloud-based analytics offered opportunities to address health risks and economic losses from poor resource quality, aligning with global sustainability goals like the EU’s energy efficiency plans.

System Design

The system integrates:





IoT Framework: ACS712 (electricity), MQ135 (air quality), pH, turbidity, and DHT11 sensors (water quality) connect to Arduino Uno and NodeMCU, sending data to Google Sheets and Adafruit dashboards via APIs.



Machine Learning: A Random Forest Regressor predicts air and water quality (PPM, NTU) for 7 days, trained on a dynamic dataset of ~400 entries.

Implementation

We deployed:





Hardware: Cost-effective sensors and NodeMCU for real-time data collection.



Data Pipeline: Sensor data is cleaned (removing NaN, converting to float/datetime) and stored securely in Google Sheets via Google API.



Predictive Model: Random Forest outperformed LSTM (RMSE: 48.304) and ARIMA (RMSE: 97.49) with a 2.94 RMSE, excelling with limited data.



Interface: A web dashboard displays real-time and predicted values in tables and graphs, with an Adafruit dashboard for electricity.

Validation

Tested in a residential setting for 28 days, the system achieved near-instantaneous updates (~0.5-second delay). Random Forest’s 2.94 RMSE and 0.58% error in electricity forecasting ensured high accuracy. Users received instant alerts for threshold breaches, enhancing resource control.
