Case Study 2: Survival of the Fittest
Overview
This project began with a constraint: designing for a narrow domestic passageway. Instead of seeing this as a limitation, I saw it as an opportunity to reimagine fitness and presence in VR. The result was a physically interactive experience that transforms everyday movement into a game-like mission, motivating users to jump, squat, and push their way through a suspenseful, apocalyptic hallway, all from the comfort (and constraints) of their own home.

The Problem
Most VR fitness experiences assume a large play area, yet the average home doesn’t offer that. My goal was to create an immersive VR experience that fits within a 3.2 ft wide × 10 ft long hallway, a ubiquitous, often overlooked space in many homes. It needed to feel purposeful, cinematic, and physical, all within a tight physical footprint.
Design Goals
Use limited physical space to inspire movement and immersion
Make players feel like they are progressing forward through action
Create spatial tension that reinforces narrative urgency
Keep the experience intuitive without needing visual explanations
Motivate through embodiment rather than gamified scoring alone
Setting & Spatial Constraints
Width: ~1m (3.2 ft)
Length: ~3m (10 ft)
Ceiling: ~2.4m (8 ft)
Rationale:
Found in most homes
Safe to use for in-place movement
Allows for seated, standing, or squat-based input

Movement as Input
The design mapped specific physical actions to movement in the virtual world:
Jumping Jacks → 0.8m forward
Bodyweight Squats → 1.5m forward
Shadow Boxing → breaks through virtual walls
Each movement served as a mechanic, not just a fitness goal. The goal was to make actions feel like progression, not repetition.

Prototype Design
The experience was broken into 3 distinct scenes:
Scene 1: Warm-Up
Light jumping jacks and squats
Orientation to space and controls
Scene 2: Main Mission
Use squats and jumping jacks to escape a collapsing hallway
Must shadow-box through debris and locked barriers
Scene 3: Mission Accomplished
Breathing space, cool down visuals, and light feedback

Tools Used
Engine: Unity 2021.3.45f1
VR Headset: Meta Quest 2
Toolkit: XR Interaction Toolkit
Animation: Mixamo
Assets: Unity Asset Store
User Testing
Two users tested the experience in similar hallway conditions. Both scored 87.5/100 on the System Usability Scale (SUS).
Key Feedback:
“I felt exhausted, but in a good way.”
“I forgot I was working out.”
“Captions would help, especially in noisy homes.”
“The hallway felt suspenseful, not restrictive.”

Design Learnings
Context-aware spatial mapping: The real hallway shaped the virtual one.
Embodied interaction: Users were more engaged when they forgot it was exercise.
Minimalist HUDs: Audio worked well, but captions improved accessibility.
Post-Test Improvements
Added captions to support noisy environments
Improved cue clarity with timed animations
Considered adding leaderboards and timers to support replayability
Revised punch interaction for better responsiveness
What I Learned
Design thrives under constraints. By designing for tight spaces, I was forced to prioritise clarity, movement, and immersion. The hallway became more than a backdrop; it was a co-actor, shaping the pace, tension, and physicality of the story.
Reflection
Design doesn’t begin with a feature list; it begins with what the space allows.
Motivation doesn’t always come from scores; it can come from embodiment.
Simple mechanics like squats and punches can be deeply immersive when framed within urgency and story.

Vision
This prototype lays the groundwork for home-based mixed reality experiences that are compact, embodied, and emotionally engaging. With minor adjustments, it could be scaled for:
Apartments or dorms
Fitness routines disguised as missions
Therapy or rehab gamification
I’d love to expand this into a multi-chapter fitness story, designed entirely for overlooked corners of our homes, such as hallways, landings, and bedrooms, transforming daily spaces into stages for presence and play.
